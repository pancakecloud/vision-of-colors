                John Dalton described his own color blindness in 1794. In common with his brother, 
                he confused scarlet with green and pink with blue. Dalton supposed that his vitreous 
                humor was tinted blue, selectively absorbing longer wavelengths. He instructed that 
                his eyes should be examined after his death, but the examination revealed that the 
                humors were perfectly clear. In experiments presented here, DNA extracted from his 
                preserved eye tissue showed that Dalton was a deuteranope, lacking the middlewave 
                photopigment of the retina. This diagnosis is shown to be compatible with the historical 
                record of his phenotype, although it contradicts Thomas Young's belief that Dalton was a protanope.
